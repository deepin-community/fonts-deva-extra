fonts-deva-extra (3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  With this release Gargi and Sarai fonts which were shipped previosuly
  as part of this package are now moved to fonts-gargi and fonts-sarai.

  The fontconfig file shipped with this package still configures the fonts
  required for Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Maithili, Konkani, and Sanskrit
  languages so to ensure proper font selection this package now recommends
  fonts-gargi and fonts-sarai please consider installing them after this
  upgrade.
